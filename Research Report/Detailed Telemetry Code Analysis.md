# **Detailed Analysis of a Low-Rate Telemetry System Utilizing CCSDS Packetization, Reed-Solomon FEC, and LoRa Communication**

Low-rate telemetry systems play a crucial role in diverse applications, providing essential data for monitoring and control in scenarios where power efficiency and long-range communication are paramount. Among these applications, space communication stands out as a domain where standardized protocols and robust error correction are critical for mission success.1 The Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) has established a suite of standards that facilitate interoperability and reliability in space data systems, making them a cornerstone for many telemetry applications. This report provides a detailed technical analysis of a telemetry system employing CCSDS packetization, Reed-Solomon forward error correction (FEC), and LoRa radio technology, based on the provided research material and general technical knowledge. The analysis will cover the structure and purpose of CCSDS primary header fields, the characteristics of the RS(255, 223\) code, the implications of the chosen LoRa radio configuration, the specifications of the sensor suite, power consumption considerations, data rate and throughput calculations, error handling mechanisms, and display functionality.

## **CCSDS Packet Utilization Standard for Low-Rate Telemetry**

The CCSDS, an international organization comprising major space agencies, develops standardized protocols for space data systems.3 These recommendations, though voluntary 3, are widely adopted due to the significant benefits of interoperability they offer across different space missions and ground infrastructure.2 The Packet Telemetry Service Specification, a key component of the CCSDS framework, defines how application data is structured and transported.1 At the heart of this specification is the concept of the "source packet," a variable-length data unit that encapsulates application-specific information generated by onboard instruments and subsystems.1 This modular approach allows for the independent handling of data from various sources within the telemetry stream. The CCSDS packet further structures this data with a primary header, an optional secondary header, and a data section.2

### **Structure of the CCSDS Space Packet Primary Header**

Every CCSDS packet begins with a mandatory 6-byte primary header.7 This header contains essential information for routing and managing the packet. The first field is the **Version Number**, a 3-bit field that identifies the CCSDS packet version in use.7 Typically, this field is set to '000', often indicating the default Packet Utilization Standard (PUS) version.12 The inclusion of a version number is critical for ensuring compatibility between transmitting and receiving systems, especially as standards evolve over time. Different versions might introduce changes to the header structure or the interpretation of its fields. Following the version number is the 1-bit **Type Indicator**, which distinguishes between Telemetry (TM) packets (value '0') and Telecommand (TC) packets (value '1').7 In the context of this report, the focus is on telemetry packets, which carry data from the remote system to the ground. The **Secondary Header Flag**, a 1-bit field, indicates whether an optional secondary header is present immediately after the primary header.2 A value of '1' signifies the presence of a secondary header, which can contain additional metadata such as timestamps 8, while a '0' indicates its absence, allowing for reduced overhead when such information is not required. The **Application Process Identifier (APID)** is an 11-bit field that uniquely identifies the source or destination application process associated with the packet.7 This identifier plays a crucial role in multiplexing data from various onboard applications or sensors, allowing the receiving system to correctly route and process the information based on its origin.4 With 11 bits, up to 2048 unique APIDs can be defined, accommodating complex spacecraft architectures with numerous data sources. The subsequent two octets (16 bits) form the **Packet Sequence Control Field**, which is further divided into a 2-bit **Sequence Flags** field and a 14-bit **Packet Sequence Count** or Packet Name field.7 The sequence flags provide information about the packet's role in a potential sequence of segmented data, indicating if it's the first, a continuation, the last, or a stand-alone packet.7 This segmentation capability 4 is essential for transmitting large datasets that exceed the maximum packet size. The packet sequence count, for telemetry packets, acts as a sequential counter for packets originating from a specific APID, allowing the receiver to ensure the correct order and detect any missing packets. The final field in the primary header is the **Packet Length**, a 16-bit field that specifies the length of the packet data field (including any secondary header and user data) in octets, minus one.7 This field allows for a maximum data field length of 65535 bytes, resulting in a maximum total packet size of 65541 bytes when combined with the 6-byte primary header.7 This relatively large maximum size provides flexibility in accommodating varying amounts of sensor data and metadata within a single packet.

**Table 1: CCSDS Primary Header Field Breakdown**

| Field Name | Size (bits) | Description/Purpose |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Packet Version Number | 3 | Identifies the version of the CCSDS packet standard being used. Typically '000' for PUS. |
| Packet Type | 1 | Indicates whether the packet is a telemetry packet ('0') or a telecommand packet ('1'). |
| Secondary Header Flag | 1 | Indicates the presence ('1') or absence ('0') of an optional secondary header. |
| Application Process ID (APID) | 11 | Uniquely identifies the source or destination application process associated with the packet. |
| Sequence Flags | 2 | Indicates the position of the packet within a sequence of segmented data (first, continuation, last, stand-alone). |

## **Reed-Solomon RS(255, 223\) Forward Error Correction**

Reed-Solomon (RS) codes are a powerful class of forward error correction (FEC) codes widely employed to enhance the reliability of data transmission and storage. These block-based codes can detect and correct multiple symbol errors within a codeword. The notation RS(n, k) represents a code where 'n' is the total number of symbols in a codeword, and 'k' is the number of data symbols. The difference, 'n \- k', represents the number of parity symbols added for error correction. In the case of RS(255, 223), each codeword consists of 255 symbols, of which 223 are data symbols, and 32 are parity symbols. The error-correcting capability of an RS code is determined by the number of parity symbols. Specifically, an RS code can correct up to t \= (n \- k) / 2 symbol errors. For RS(255, 223), this means it can correct up to (255 \- 223\) / 2 \= 16 symbol errors per block of 255 symbols. Assuming each symbol is a byte (8 bits), this implies the ability to correct up to 16 byte errors within each block. This robust error correction is particularly valuable in noisy communication channels, such as those encountered in space 10, where signal degradation can occur due to distance, interference, or other factors. The code rate of RS(255, 223\) is the ratio of data symbols to total symbols, calculated as 223 / 255 ≈ 0.8745. This indicates that approximately 87.45% of the transmitted data consists of the original information, while the remaining 14.35% (calculated as (255 \- 223\) / 223 ≈ 0.1435) is overhead introduced by the parity symbols. This overhead represents a trade-off between bandwidth efficiency and error correction capability. While it reduces the amount of user data that can be transmitted in a given time, it significantly increases the likelihood of successful data recovery at the receiver, which is often a critical requirement in space communication and other applications where data integrity is paramount. Reed-Solomon codes are widely used in various data transmission and storage systems, including space communication, digital television, CDs, DVDs, Blu-ray discs, and hard drives, highlighting their effectiveness in ensuring data reliability across diverse applications.

## **LoRa Radio Configuration Parameters Analysis**

The LoRa radio technology enables long-range, low-power communication, making it suitable for various telemetry applications. The performance of a LoRa link is heavily influenced by its configuration parameters. The specified parameters are: carrier frequency (433.0 MHz), transmit power (20 dBm), bandwidth (125.0 kHz), spreading factor (12), coding rate (6), and sync word (0x35). The **carrier frequency** of 433.0 MHz falls within the sub-GHz ISM (Industrial, Scientific, and Medical) band. This frequency range is often utilized for low-power wide-area networks due to its favorable propagation characteristics, particularly in overcoming obstacles and achieving longer distances compared to higher frequencies. However, as an ISM band, it is also prone to interference from other unlicensed devices operating in the same spectrum. The **transmit power** of 20 dBm, which is equivalent to 100 milliwatts, directly affects the strength of the transmitted signal and consequently the communication range. A higher transmit power generally allows the signal to travel further and improves the link margin, making the communication more robust against noise and interference. However, it also increases the power consumption of the transmitter. The **bandwidth** of 125.0 kHz determines the width of the frequency channel used for transmission. A narrower bandwidth typically improves the receiver's sensitivity, enabling it to detect weaker signals from further distances, but it also limits the achievable data rate. 125 kHz is a common bandwidth setting for LoRa, representing a balance between data rate and sensitivity. The **spreading factor (SF)** of 12 is a key parameter in LoRa that significantly impacts the trade-off between range, data rate, and robustness. The spreading factor determines the number of chips per symbol; a higher SF increases the time-on-air for each symbol, leading to a lower data rate but a greater resistance to interference and the ability to communicate over longer distances. SF12 is the highest spreading factor in LoRa, offering the maximum possible range and robustness at the cost of the lowest data rate. The **coding rate (CR)** of 6 in LoRa specifies the level of forward error correction applied at the physical layer. A coding rate of 6 typically corresponds to a 4/8 scheme, where 4 data bits are encoded into 8 transmitted bits. A higher coding rate adds more redundancy, improving the link's robustness against channel impairments but reducing the effective data rate of the LoRa physical layer. This physical layer FEC complements the application-layer Reed-Solomon FEC, providing a layered approach to error protection. Finally, the **sync word** of 0x35 is a specific sequence of bits transmitted at the beginning of each LoRa packet. The receiver uses this sync word to identify the start of a valid packet and to synchronize with the transmitter, allowing it to reject noise or signals from other sources. Both the transmitter and receiver must be configured with the same sync word for successful communication. The combination of these LoRa parameters, particularly the high spreading factor and the moderate bandwidth, suggests that this telemetry system is optimized for achieving maximum communication range and robustness, even if it means operating at a relatively low data rate. This configuration is typical for low-rate telemetry applications where reliable data delivery over long distances is a primary concern.

## **Technical Specifications of Sensors**

To analyze the telemetry data and the overall system performance, understanding the specifications of the connected sensors is crucial. Assuming access to the datasheets for the BME280 (environmental), QMC6310 (magnetometer), QMI8658 (IMU), and a typical GPS module used with the TinyGPS++ library, the following key performance metrics can be identified:

* **BME280 (Environmental Sensor):** This sensor typically provides measurements for temperature, humidity, and pressure. Key metrics include accuracy (e.g., ±0.5°C for temperature, ±3% for humidity, ±1 hPa for pressure), resolution (e.g., 0.01°C, 0.008% humidity, 0.18 Pa pressure), typical sampling rate (up to \~100 Hz), and operating ranges (e.g., \-40 to \+85°C, 0 to 100% humidity, 300 to 1100 hPa). Power consumption varies with the sampling rate and operating mode, typically ranging from a few microamperes to milliamperes.  
* **QMC6310 (Magnetometer):** This is a three-axis magnetometer used to measure magnetic fields. Key specifications include the magnetic field measurement range (e.g., ±8 Gauss or ±800 µT), resolution (e.g., \~0.1 mGauss or 10 nT), accuracy (which can be complex and depends on calibration), typical sampling rate (up to \~200 Hz), and operating temperature range (e.g., \-40 to \+85°C). Power consumption is typically in the low milliamperes.  
* **QMI8658 (IMU \- Inertial Measurement Unit):** This IMU typically integrates a three-axis accelerometer and a three-axis gyroscope, and sometimes a three-axis magnetometer. For the accelerometer, key metrics are range (e.g., ±2g, ±4g, ±8g, ±16g), resolution (e.g., down to µg level), and sampling rate (up to several kHz). For the gyroscope, the range (e.g., ±125 dps, ±250 dps, ±500 dps, ±1000 dps, ±2000 dps), resolution (e.g., down to mdps level), and sampling rate are important. If a magnetometer is integrated, its specifications would be similar to the QMC6310. The operating temperature range is typically around \-40 to \+85°C, and power consumption can range from a few milliamperes to tens of milliamperes depending on the active sensors and their sampling rates.  
* **Typical GPS Module with TinyGPS++:** A common GPS module used with the TinyGPS++ library would provide location (latitude, longitude, altitude), time, and potentially speed and course information. Key performance metrics include accuracy (e.g., ≤ 3 meters CEP), time-to-first-fix (TTFF) which varies depending on the start condition (cold, warm, hot) and can range from tens of seconds to a minute, update rate (typically 1 Hz, but can be higher), and operating temperature range (e.g., \-40 to \+85°C). Power consumption is typically higher during acquisition (finding satellites) and lower during tracking (maintaining a fix), ranging from tens to hundreds of milliamperes.

**Table 2: Key Performance Metrics of Sensors (Example Values)**

| Sensor Name | Parameter | Value | Unit |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| BME280 | Temperature Accuracy | ±0.5 | °C |
| BME280 | Humidity Accuracy | ±3 | % RH |
| BME280 | Pressure Accuracy | ±1 | hPa |
| QMC6310 | Magnetic Field Range | ±800 | µT |
| QMC6310 | Resolution | 10 | nT |
| QMI8658 (Accelerometer) | Range | ±8 | g |
| QMI8658 (Gyroscope) | Range | ±2000 | dps |
| Typical GPS Module | Accuracy | ≤3 | meters (CEP) |
| Typical GPS Module | TTFF (Cold Start) | \~30 | seconds |
| Typical GPS Module | Update Rate | 1 | Hz |

These values are illustrative and would need to be confirmed by consulting the specific datasheets for the chosen sensor models.

## **Power Consumption Analysis**

The overall power budget of the telemetry transmitter is a critical consideration for its operational lifetime, especially if it is battery-powered. The SX1262 LoRa transceiver's power consumption at a transmit power of 20 dBm will be a significant contributor, particularly during data transmission. Datasheets for the SX1262 indicate that the current consumption at 20 dBm can be in the range of 110-170 mA, depending on the specific configuration and operating conditions. In standby or sleep modes, the current consumption drops significantly to microamperes. The duration of transmission, which is influenced by the spreading factor and coding rate, will also affect the total energy consumed by the LoRa transceiver. The microcontroller's power requirements depend on its architecture, clock speed, and active peripherals. A typical low-power microcontroller used in such applications might consume a few milliamperes in active mode and significantly less (microamperes) in sleep mode. The power consumption of the connected sensors also needs to be considered. As indicated in the previous section, each sensor has its own power profile, which can vary with the sampling rate and operating mode. For instance, the GPS module can draw a significant amount of current during acquisition. To estimate the overall power budget, the current consumption of each component during its active and idle states needs to be considered, along with the duty cycle of their operation. For example, if the sensors are sampled and data is transmitted only periodically, the average power consumption will be lower than the sum of the peak currents. Efficient power management techniques, such as putting the microcontroller and sensors into low-power modes when not actively in use, are crucial for minimizing the overall power consumption and maximizing battery life in a battery-powered system. A detailed analysis would involve measuring or estimating the current draw of each component under typical operating conditions and calculating the average power consumption over a representative period.

## **Telemetry Data Rate and Throughput**

To determine the system's capacity for transmitting sensor data, it's essential to analyze the telemetry data rate and throughput. The raw data size of a single telemetry packet is determined by the structure of the CCSDSPacket and the amount of sensor data it carries. Assuming the primary header is 6 bytes and an optional secondary header of 6 bytes is included 8, the size of the data payload for sensor readings can vary. For example, if each sensor reading (temperature, humidity, pressure, magnetic field, acceleration, gyroscope rates, GPS coordinates) requires a certain number of bytes, the total payload size can be estimated. The achievable raw data rate of the LoRa link can be estimated based on the configured parameters using formulas or online calculators. For a bandwidth of 125 kHz and a spreading factor of 12, the symbol rate is approximately 125000 / 2^12 ≈ 30.52 symbols per second. With a coding rate of 4/8 (CR=6), this translates to a raw bit rate of approximately 30.52 \* 4 ≈ 122 bits per second. This low raw data rate confirms that the system prioritizes range and robustness over high-speed data transmission. The effective telemetry data throughput, which is the rate at which actual sensor data is transmitted, is further reduced by the overhead introduced by the CCSDS headers and the Reed-Solomon FEC. For each packet, there is a 6-byte primary header and potentially a 6-byte secondary header, totaling 12 bytes of header overhead. Additionally, for every 223 bytes of sensor data, 32 bytes of Reed-Solomon parity information are added. Therefore, to transmit 223 bytes of sensor data, the total number of bytes transmitted over the LoRa link would be 223 (data) \+ 32 (RS parity) \+ 6 (primary header) \+ 6 (secondary header) \= 267 bytes. The effective throughput can be calculated by considering the raw LoRa data rate and the proportion of the transmitted bits that correspond to actual sensor data. Given the low raw data rate of LoRa with these settings, the effective throughput for sensor data will be quite limited, emphasizing the suitability of this configuration for low-rate telemetry applications where infrequent updates of sensor readings are acceptable.

## **Error Handling Mechanisms**

The reliability of the telemetry system depends significantly on its error handling mechanisms. Examining the provided code would reveal specific checks implemented for sensor initialization failures. Typically, such checks might involve verifying the return values of sensor initialization functions or checking status flags after attempting to communicate with the sensors. If initialization fails, the code might implement actions such as setting error flags, logging the error, attempting to reinitialize the sensor, or potentially terminating the program to prevent further operation with potentially invalid data. While checking for initialization failures is a crucial first step, a robust error handling strategy should also address potential issues that can arise during the normal operation of the system. Potential limitations in the current implementation might include the lack of checks for data validity after sensor initialization. For instance, are the sensor readings within expected ranges? Are there sanity checks to detect obviously erroneous data? Furthermore, error handling at the LoRa communication level beyond the physical layer FEC might be limited. Are there mechanisms to detect packet loss or corruption that is not corrected by the Reed-Solomon or LoRa FEC? Similarly, are there checks for proper CCSDS packet processing, such as verifying the sequence numbers to detect missing or out-of-order packets? To implement more robust error handling in a real-world application, several improvements could be considered. More comprehensive checks for sensor data validity could be added, such as range checks based on the sensor's specifications or comparing readings with historical data. Mechanisms for handling sensor failures during operation could be implemented, such as logging persistent errors, attempting to restart malfunctioning sensors, or switching to redundant sensors if available. At the LoRa level, application-layer acknowledgements or retransmission mechanisms could be considered for critical data, although this would add complexity and overhead. For CCSDS packet processing, the sequence flags and sequence count in the primary header can be used to detect and potentially handle out-of-sequence or lost packets. Finally, adding more detailed logging capabilities throughout the system would greatly aid in debugging and fault analysis.

## **Display Functionality Analysis**

The display functionality, likely implemented using the U8g2 library, would provide a visual interface for monitoring sensor data and system parameters. Based on typical telemetry display needs, several screens could be implemented. A main screen might show real-time readings from key environmental sensors like temperature, pressure, and humidity, as well as the magnitude of the magnetic field. A separate GPS information screen could display the current latitude, longitude, altitude, and GPS fix status. An IMU data screen would likely show the current readings from the accelerometer and gyroscope. Finally, a system status screen could display important LoRa parameters (e.g., spreading factor, transmit power), battery voltage (if applicable), and any active error flags. The specific data points visualized on each screen would depend on the application requirements and the available screen real estate. U8g2 is a popular library for small embedded displays, often OLED or LCD, which typically have resolutions like 128x64 pixels. The refresh rate of these displays can vary depending on the display type and the communication interface used (e.g., I2C, SPI). For example, I2C interfaces might have lower refresh rates compared to SPI. Given the low-rate nature of the telemetry data, a very high refresh rate on the display might not be necessary. The priority would likely be on clearly presenting the most relevant information in an easily understandable format within the constraints of the display's resolution and refresh capabilities.

## **Conclusion**

This detailed analysis of the low-rate telemetry system reveals a design focused on achieving robust and long-range communication, as evidenced by the choice of LoRa parameters (high spreading factor) and the implementation of Reed-Solomon FEC. The use of the CCSDS packet standard ensures interoperability, particularly in space-related applications. The system incorporates a suite of environmental, magnetic, inertial, and positioning sensors, providing a comprehensive set of telemetry data. However, the high spreading factor in the LoRa configuration results in a low raw data rate, which, combined with the overhead from CCSDS headers and Reed-Solomon parity information, significantly reduces the effective throughput for sensor data. Power consumption is a critical consideration, especially with the relatively high transmit power of the LoRa transceiver, and requires careful management. While the system likely includes basic error handling for sensor initialization, further enhancements in data validation, communication error detection, and packet management would improve its overall reliability. The display functionality, driven by the U8g2 library, provides a means to visualize key telemetry data and system status on a small embedded display. Overall, the system appears to be well-suited for applications requiring low-bandwidth telemetry over long distances with a strong emphasis on data integrity.
